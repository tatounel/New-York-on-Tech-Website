                    <h2> About New York on Tech </h2>
                    
                    <p>New York On Tech (NYOT) prepares the next generation of technology leaders emerging from New York City by creating pathways for underrepresented students to thrive in technology and innovation.</p>
                    <p>This project was created as part of NYOT's TECH360 Squad program: a free, nine week after-school program for 10th, 11th and 12th graders enrolled in New York City high schools. Students enrolled in the program learn the fundamentals of web design and development. Courses take place at companies in New York City and are taught by tech professionals.</p>
                    <p>NYOT has been really helpful in teaching me new programming languages and I loved every second of this program.</p>
